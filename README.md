Hi, I'm Peter MacDonaldðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student with the Get Coding coaching program. Based out of St.John's Newfoundland, I am currently writting in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a passion for creating and hope to make some intuitive and diverse projects to learn all about this world. I am excited to work on new projects/ideas and see them through. 

:bulb: You  can check out my first project, Song Circle Schedule Creator through the link below. This project was designed to aid in scheduling music festival competitions, such as Song Circles or the Kiwanis Music Festival.

:cartwheeling: Fun Fact about me, I'm a musician and a studio owner. I would love to be involved in any projects.
