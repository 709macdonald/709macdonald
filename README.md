Peter MacDonald's Github ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student with the Get Coding coaching program. Based out of St.John's Newfoundland, I am currently writting in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a passion for music and hope to make the industry better with intuitive and diverse projects to enhance the musicians experience. I am excited to work on new projects/ideas and see them through. 

You  can check out my first project, Song Circle Schedule Creator through the link below. This project was designed to aid in scheduling music festival competitions, such as Song Circles or the Kiwanis Music Festival.
